<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
My name is Shirley Wang. I'm a writer from Iowa City, Iowa. 
</p>
<p>
My radio story "<a href="https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2018/12/14/lin-wang-charles-barkley">My Dad’s Friendship with Charles Barkley</a> for NPR’s Only A Game, about my late father and his unusual friendship with a basketball celebrity, came out in 2018 and received millions of listeners around the world. I got to hear from all sorts of people about how they were moved by this story of grieving, as they reflected on their own meaningful life experiences. 
</p>
<p>
Their reactions (which I wrote about <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2019/06/14/shirley-wang-lin-charles-barkley-reflection">here</a>) reminded me that with the right combination of care and story craft, it is possible to tell powerful, memorable stories about anyone. Currently, I work with publications and media organizations to create fresh, funny, and emotionally resonating pieces around issues of everyday life. I am fascinated by complicated interpersonal dynamics, miscommunication, and the rich inner lives people have whilst they go about their day. Hopefully reading my writing makes people feel seen, and less alone.
